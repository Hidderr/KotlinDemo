Adults are often surprised by how well they remember something they learned as children but have never practised in the meantime(同时).
A man who has not had an opportunity（时机） to go swimming for years can   1     swim as well as ever when he gets back in the water.
 He can got on a bicycle after several decades（数十年） and still   2     away.
 A mother who has not   3     the words for years can teach her daughter the poem（诗） that begins “Twinkle, twinkle, little star”
 or recite（背诵） the story of Cinderella（灰姑娘） or Snow White.
    One explanation is the law of over-learning, which can be stated as following:  4        we have learned something,
    additional learning increases the   5       of time we will remember it.
    In childhood, we usually continue to practise such skills as swimming, bicycle riding long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to
     and   6       ourselves of poems such as “Twinkle, twinkle, little star” and childhood tales（故事） such as Cinderella or Snow White.
     We not only learn but   7       .
    The law of over learning explains why cramming (突击学习) for an examination,  8  it may result in a passing grade,
    is not a  9         way to learn a school course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination,
    but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned. A little over learning,  10     , is usually a good investment（投入） toward the future.

Passage One
　　All the housewives who went to the new supermarket had one great ambition: to be the lucky customer who did not have to pay for her shopping. For this was what the notice just inside the entrance promised. It said: “Remember, once a week, one of our customers gets free goods. This May Be Your Lucky Day!”
　　For several weeks Mrs. Edwards hoped, like many of her friends, to be the lucky customer. Unlike her friends, she never gave up hoping. The cupboards in kitchen were full of things which she did not need. Her husband tried to advise her against buying things but failed. She dreamed of the day when the manager of the supermarket would approach her and say: “Madam, this is Your Lucky Day. Everything in your basket is free.”
　　One Friday morning, after she had finished her shopping and had taken it to her car, she found that she had forgotten to buy any tea. She dashed back to the supermarket, got the tea and went towards the cash-desk. As she did so, she saw the manager of the supermarket approach her. “Madam,” he said, holding out his hand, “I want to congratulate you!

Passage Two
　　Deep inside a mountain near Sweetwater in East. Tennessee is a body of water known as the Lost Sea. It is listed by the Guinness Book of Would Records as the world’s largest underground lake. The Lost Sea is part of an extensive and historic cave system called Craighead Caverns.
　　The caverns have been known and used since the days of the Cherokee Indian nation. The cave expands into a series of huge rooms from a small opening on the side of the mountain. Approximately one mile from the entrance, in a room called “The Council Room,” many Indian artisfacts have been found. Some of the items discovered include pottery, arrowheads, weapons, and jewelry.
　　For many years there were persistent rumors of a large underground lake somewhere in a cave, but it was not discovered until 1905. In that year, a thirteen-year-old boy named Ben Sands crawled through a small opening three hundred feet underground. He found himself in a large cave half filled with water.
　　Today tourists visit the Lost Sea and ride far out onto it in glass-bottomed boats powered by electric motors. More than thirteen acres of water have been mapped out so far and still no end to the lake has been found. Even though teams of divers have tried to explore the Lost Sea, the full extent of it is still unknown.

Passage Three
　　Generations of Americans have been brought up to believe that a good breakfast is one life’s essentials. Eating breakfast at the start of the day, we have all been told, and told again, is as necessary as putting gasoline in the family car before starting a trip.
　　But for many people the thought of food first thing in the morning is by no means a pleasure. So despite all the efforts, they still take no breakfast. Between 1977 and 1983, the latest year for which figures are available, the number of people who didn’t have breakfast, increased by 33 percent.
　　For those who feel pain of guilt about not eating breakfast, however, there is some good news. Several studies in the last few years indicate that, for adults especially, there may be nothing wrong with omitting breakfast. “Going without breakfast does not affect performance,” said Arrold E. Bender, former professor of the nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College in London, “nor does giving people breakfast improve performance.”
　　Scientific evidence linking breakfast to better health or better performance is surprisingly inadequate, and most of the recent work involves children, not adults, “The literature”, says one researcher, Dr. Erresto at the University of Texas, “is poor”.
　　1. The latest year for which figures could be obtained is _______.
　　A. the year the author wrote the article B. 1977
C. any year between 1997 and 1983 D. 1983
THE_ANSWER:D
　　2. For those who do not take breakfast, the good news is that _______.
　　A.several studies have been done in the past few years
　　B.the omission of breakfast does no harm to one’s health
　　C.adults have especially made studies in this field
D.eating little in the morning is good for health
THE_ANSWER:B
　　3. “…nor does giving people breakfast improve performance” means ______.
　　A.anyone without breakfast does improve his performance
　　B.not giving people breakfast improve performance
　　C.having breakfast does not improve performance, either
D.people having breakfast do improve their performance
THE_ANSWER:C
　　4. The word “literature” in the last sentence refers to _______.
　　A. stories, poems, plays, etc. B. written works on a particular subject
C. any printed material D. the modern literature of America
THE_ANSWER:B
　　5. What is implied but NOT stated by the author is that _______.
　　A.breakfast does not affect performance
　　B.Dr. Erresto is engaged in research work at an institution of higher learning
　　C.not eating breakfast might affect the health of children
D.Professor Bender once taught college courses in nutrition in London
THE_ANSWER:C    

Passage Four
　　About 35% of all high school graduates in America continue their education in an institution of higher learning. The word college is used to refer to either a college or a university. These institutions offer four-year programs that lead to a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor Science (B.S.) degree. Some students attend a junior college (providing only a two-year program) for one to two years before entering a four-year college as a sophomore (二年级生) or junior (三年级生).
　　It is generally easier to be accepted at a state university than at a private one. Most private schools require strict entrance examinations and a high grade point average (GPA), as well as specific college prep classes in high school. Private schools cost considerably more than state colleges and famous private schools are very expensive. Poorer students can sometimes attend, however, by earning scholarships. Some college graduates go on to earn advanced masters or doctoral degrees in grad (graduate) school. Occupations in certain fields such as law or medicine require such advanced studies.
　　Since college costs are very high, most students work at part-time jobs. Some have full-time jobs and go to school part-time. Often some will take five or more years to complete a four-year program because of money / job demands on their time.
　　While the college and work demands take up the great part of a student’s time, most still enjoy social activities. Sports, dances, clubs, movies, and plays are all very popular. However, gathering together for long, philosophical talks at a favorite meeting place on or near the university is probably the most popular activity.
　　1. College education is _______ in America.
　　A. quite common B. very rare
C. something difficult D. almost impossible
THE_ANSWER:A
　　2. Which of the following is NOT required for entering most private schools.
　　A. entrance examinations B. taking part in many activities
C. GPA D. college prep classes
THE_ANSWER:B
　　3. How can poor students attend private schools?
　　A. Only by working at part-time jobs. B. Only by working at full-time jobs.
C. Only by earning scholarships. D. All of above.
THE_ANSWER:D
　　4. The American college students like to _______ most of all.
　　A. discuss problems on philosophy B. play balls

Passage Five
What would it be like to take a walk on the surface of Mars? If you could design the tallest building in the world, what would it look like? Do you dream of being the next J.K.Rowling? This summer, you can experience all of these things, and more. All you need is an Internet connection and your imagination. 
A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that kids spend an average of 1 hour and 29 minutes online each day. Many kids like to use that time to chat with friends, play games or check e-mails. But next time you get on the Web, try exploring the world instead. “With the Internet, you can go back 11,000 years in time, or go 11,000 kilometers across the planet,” said Russell, Web search expert of Google. “The whole scope of history and the world is open to you.”
There is a wealth of information to be found online. For example, if your family  is going on vacation somewhere, do a quick online search on the area before you even get in the car. “What’s the background of the place; what’s the history?” says Russell. “I like to tell my kids, ‘Whenever you have a question, whenever you have a doubt, search it out.’”

Passage Six

ln the animal kingdom, weakness can bring about aggression in other animals.This sometimes happens with humans also.But I have found that my weakness brings out the kindness in people.I see it every day when people hold doors for me, pour cream into my coffee, or help me to put on my coat.And I have discovered that it makes them happy.
    From my wheelchair experience, I see the best in people, but sometimes I feel sad because those who appear independent miss the kindness I see daily.They don’t  get to see this soft side of others.Often, we try every way possible to avoid showing our weakness, which includes a lot of pretending.But only when we stop pretending we’re brave or strong do we allow people to show the kindness that’s in them.
    Last month, when I was driving home on a busy highway, I began to feel unwell and drove more slowly than usual.People behind me began to get impatient and angry, with some speeding up alongside me, horning (按喇叭) or even shouting at me.At that moment，I decided to do something I had never done in twentyfour years of driving.I put on the car flashlights and drove on at a really low speed.、
o more angry shouts and no more horns!When I put on my flashlights, I was saying to the other drivers, “I have a problem here.I am weak and doing the best I can.” And everyone understood.Several times, I saw drivers who wanted to pas s.They couldn’t get aro und me because of the stream of passing traffic. But instead of getting impatient and angry, they waited, knowing the driver in front of them was in some way weak.
Sometimes situations call for us to act strong and brave even when we don’t feel that way.But those are few and far between.More often, it would be better if we don’t pretend we feel strong when we feel weak or pretend that we’re brave when we’re scared.
